## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key
- poppler-utils (for PDF to image conversion)

### Installing poppler-utils

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install poppler
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

**Windows:**
Download from [poppler-windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows) and add to PATH.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5001
   ```

## Usage

1. **Enter your Gemini API Key** in the configuration section
2. **Configure Excel columns** by adding column names and descriptions for the data you want to extract
3. **Upload a PDF invoice** by clicking the upload area or dragging and dropping
4. **Click "Extract Invoice Data"** to process the invoice
5. **Download the Excel file** with the extracted data

## API Key Setup

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Create a new API key, it's FREE.
3. Copy the API key and paste it into the application

## Column Configuration

Define custom columns for your Excel output:

- **Column Name**: The exact name that will appear in the Excel file
- **Description**: A detailed description of what data to extract for this column

### Example Column Configurations:

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Invoice Number | The unique invoice number or reference |
| Invoice Date | The date when the invoice was issued |
| Due Date | The payment due date |
| Vendor Name | The name of the company or person who issued the invoice |
| Customer Name | The name of the customer or recipient |
| Total Amount | The total amount due on the invoice |
| Tax Amount | The tax amount included in the total |
| Currency | The currency used (USD, EUR, etc.) |
| Payment Terms | Payment terms like "Net 30", "Due on receipt", etc. |
| Line Items | Description of products or services |

## How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**: The uploaded PDF is converted to a high-resolution image using pdf2image
2. **AI Analysis**: Both the original PDF and the converted image are sent to Gemini 2.5 Pro
3. **Data Extraction**: Gemini analyzes the invoice and extracts data based on your column descriptions
4. **Excel Generation**: The extracted data is formatted into an Excel file with your custom columns
5. **Download**: The Excel file is generated and made available for download

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to convert PDF to image"**
   - Ensure poppler-utils is installed correctly
   - Check if the PDF file is corrupted

2. **"Gemini API error"**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check if you have sufficient API quota

3. **"No valid JSON found in response"**
   - The AI might not have found the requested data
   - Try adjusting your column descriptions to be more specific

### Performance Tips:

- Use high-quality PDF files for better extraction accuracy
- Be specific in your column descriptions
- For large invoices, consider splitting into smaller sections
